# Meme-Generator-React-App
This is a web application created using the ReactJS library.<br/> It is a Meme Generator wherein you can type a top text and a bottom text and then generate random meme images to fit the context.

# Very IMPORTANT
Due to the limitaion on the number of files, I have left out a folder called **node_modules** which is automatically created as soon as you create your new react app. <br/>
To make this web app work on your system follow the below steps: <br/>
1. Open Command Prompt (on windows) anywhere and type - **npx create-react-app temp** <br/>
2. You will see that a new folder with the name **temp** has been created.<br/>
3. Go inside temp and copy the **node_modules** folder.<br/>
4. Paste the copied folder into **meme-generator** folder.<br/>

# Getting-Started
Inside the meme-generator folder open Command Prompt (on windows) and type - **npm start** <br/>
The app will automatically open in the web browser.<br/>
If it does not, then open <a>http://localhost:3000</a> to view it in the browser.
